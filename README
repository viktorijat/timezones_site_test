To use the app you need to
- start the virtualenv in timezones_site with source venv/bin/activate when you are in the timezones_site_folder
- and then in the requirements.txt file there is the pip freeze which needs to be installed
- if you are using an IDE then the project interpreter needs to be set to the one in the venv, it is Python 2.7
- after that just run the server
